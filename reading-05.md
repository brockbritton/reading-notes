## Things I want to know more about

### Thinking in React
What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?
- each component should only do one thing - if a component does more than one thing, break it up
What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?
- to build a site without interactivity that renders the projected UI
Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?
- interactivity
What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?
- Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it isn’t state.
- Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it isn’t state.
- Can you compute it based on existing state or props in your component? If so, it definitely isn’t state!
How can you identify where state needs to live?

### High Order Functions
What is a “higher-order function”?
Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?
Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions.
