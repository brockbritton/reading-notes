# Reading Notes
This website is a place for my reading notes, during classes taken at **Code Fellows**.

> [!NOTE]
>  I tested into Code 301, so there will be no reading notes for 102 or 201.

## Code 301 - Intermediate Software Development

### Reading 01 - Introduction to React and Components 

### Reading 02 - State and Props
