# Reading Notes
This website is a place for my reading notes, during classes taken at **Code Fellows**.

> [!NOTE]
>  I tested into Code 301, so there will be no reading notes for 102 or 201.

## Code 301 - Intermediate Software Development

### Things I want to know more about 

### Reading 01 - Introduction to React and Components

Components and Props are super important for React as they are the base for data and visual display.

Components
1. What is a “component”?
    -  A reusable piece of code
2. What are the characteristics of a component?
   - reusable
   - replaceable
   - not context-specific
   - extensible
   - encapsulated
   - independent - minimal dependencies
3. What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?
   - ease of deployment
   - reduced cost of development and maintenance
   - reusable
   - modification of technical complexity
   - reliability
   - easy to change and update without affecting the rest of the system
   - independent

Props
1. What is “props” short for?
   - properties
3. How are props used in React?
   - to pass data to components 
5. What is the flow of props?
   - top-down


### Reading 02 - State and Props

React Lifecycle
1. Based on the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?
2. What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?
3. Put the following things in the order that they happen:
   - componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates
5. What does componentDidMount do?

React State vs Props
1. What types of things can you pass in the props?
2. What is the big difference between props and state?
3. When do we re-render our application?
4. hat are some examples of things that we could store in state?
