## Things I want to know more about

### Functional Programming Concepts
1. What is functional programming?
- it is a programming style of building that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data
2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
- a pure function is one in which the same data always comes back given the same input with no side affects
3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
- predictable and easier to understand
4. What is immutability?
- state cannot change after creation
5. What is Referential transparency?
- if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent

### Nodejs Tutorial
1. What is a module?
- the blocks of encapsulated code that communicate with an external application on the basis of their related functionality
2. What does the word ‘require’ do?
- it imports resources 
3. How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
- we use require
4. What do we have to do to make a module available?
- we use npm install
