## Things I want to know more about

### What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team
1. To what extent did psychological safety impact your previous work experience?
  - All of my professional jobs to this point have been roles in which i worked primarily alone. When I worked at the austen riggs center, while i would meet with other employees, I worked on my own otherwise. It was in those meeting that i felt psychologically safe, and helped me feel confident about the work i was doing on my own and bringing that work to those meetings.
2. How does this article inform your approach to working with others moving forward?  
  - I think a really interesting part is that there doesnt seem to be a perfect recipe for the types of people who need to be in a successful group. I always worry about who i will work with, and now maybe i can focus more on **how** i work with the people around me.
